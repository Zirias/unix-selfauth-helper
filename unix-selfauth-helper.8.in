.Sh NAME
.Nm unix-selfauth-helper
.Nd local self-authentication for pam_exec
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is designed to be called by
.Xr pam_exec 8
and enables unprivileged authentication against the local
.Xr passwd 5
database for the user calling it.
This is useful especially for screen lockers that would otherwise need their
own suid-root helper.
.Pp
To use it, add it to the
.Cm auth
stack as
.Cm sufficient
.Em above
.Xr pam_unix 8 .
Required options for
.Xr pam_exec 8
are
.Cm return_prog_exit_status
and
.Cm expose_authtok .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PAM_SM_FUNC
.It Ev PAM_SM_FUNC
must be set to
.Cm pam_sm_authenticate ,
every other value is ignored with an error exit status.
.It Ev PAM_USER
the name of the user to authenticate, must match the user attempting the
authentication.

.Ed
.sp
This PAM configuration enables self-authentication in addition to whatever
is configured system-wide for PAM.
It must be placed in
.Pa &&LOCALBASE&&/etc/pam.d ,
named like the PAM service policy.
.Pp
Only the
.Cm auth
facility is active in this example, the others are commented.
Add them if your service policy needs them.
.Pp
Hint for port maintainers: If you want to include a service policy in your
port, replace &&LOCALBASE&& with %%LOCALBASE%% and include the file in
.Cm SUB_FILES .

.Sh BUGS
This is a hack that shouldn't be necessary.
.Pp
The underlying problem is that PAM authentication
.Em might
require root privileges, depending on the modules used.
This is typically true for
.Xr pam_unix 8
because it needs to read the
.Xr passwd 5
database.
.Pp
A clean solution could be an authentication service in base that's queried by
.Xr pam_unix 8
instead of accessing the
.Xr passwd 5
database directly.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
The
.Nm
utility is installed suid-root, so it can access the
.Xr passwd 5
database.
It drops privileges as early as possible, but it could be used for guessing
the password of a user, if an attacker has access to an unlocked session of
that user.
